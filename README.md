Satsense is an open source Python library for patch based land-use and land-cover classification, initially
developed for a project on deprived neighborhood detection. However, many of the algorithms made available
through Satsense can be applied in other domains, such as ecology and climate science.

Satsense is based on readily available open source libraries, such as opencv for machine learning and the
rasterio/gdal and netcdf libraries for data access. It has a modular design that makes it easy to add your own
hand-crafted feature or use deep learning instead.

Detection of deprived neighborhoods is a land-use classification problem that is traditionally solved using
hand crafted features like HoG, Lacunarity, NDXI, Pantex, Texton, and SIFT, computed from very high resolution
satellite images. One of the goals of Satsense is to facilitate assessing the performance of these features on
practical applications. To achieve this Satsense provides an easy to use open source reference implementation for
these and other features, as well as facilities to distribute feature computation over multiple cpuâ€™s. In the future the
library will also provide easy access to metrics for assessing algorithm performance.

* satsense - library for analysing satellite images, performance evaluation, etc.
* notebooks - IPython notebooks for illustrating and testing the usage of Satsense

We are using python 3.6/3.7 and jupyter notebook for our code.

## Installation from github

Assuming you have [conda](https://conda.io) installed and are in the
directory where you have checked out this repository, you can install
the dependencies by running:

```bash
conda create --name satsense python=3
conda activate satsense
conda env update
```

If you prefer to use the package manager of your OS, use it to install
the [GDAL](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/) and
[netCDF4](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/) dependencies. 

### Ubuntu Linux 18.04 and later

Clone the repository.

Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
sudo apt install libgdal-dev libnetcdf-dev
```
When using your OS's package manager, you may still want to create and
activate a virtual environment for satsense, e.g. using
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venv/satsense
source ~/venv/satsense/bin/activate
```

Finally, to install satsense, run
```bash
pip install .
```
